//! Connection state machine for tunnel lifecycle

use tokio::sync::watch;

use crate::tunnel::types::TunnelState;

/// State machine for connection lifecycle
///
/// Manages QUIC tunnel connection states with validated transitions.
/// Uses watch channels for efficient state change broadcasting.
///
/// # States
///
/// - `Disconnected`: Initial state, no connection
/// - `Connecting`: Attempting to establish connection
/// - `Connected`: Connection established and healthy
/// - `Reconnecting`: Attempting to reconnect after failure
/// - `Failed`: Connection failed, awaiting retry
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This struct is clone-safe and can be shared across threads.
/// Each clone gets its own receiver for state changes.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use synesis_cloud::tunnel::state::ConnectionStateMachine;
/// use synesis_cloud::tunnel::TunnelState;
///
/// let sm = ConnectionStateMachine::new();
/// assert!(matches!(sm.current(), TunnelState::Disconnected));
///
/// // Transition to connecting
/// sm.transition(TunnelState::Connecting {
///     since: std::time::Instant::now(),
/// });
/// ```
