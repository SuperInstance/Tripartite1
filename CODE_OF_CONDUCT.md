# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within

## Additional SuperInstance Community Guidelines

### Inclusivity Statement

SuperInstance AI is committed to creating an inclusive, welcoming environment for
everyone, regardless of background or experience level. We believe that diverse
perspectives strengthen our project and help us build better software.

### Expectations for All Community Members

**In All Spaces:**
- Be respectful and considerate
- Use inclusive and welcoming language
- Be collaborative (welcome newcomers, help others learn)
- Focus on what is best for the community

**In Discussions:**
- Listen to and understand different viewpoints
- Assume good intentions
- Critique ideas, not people
- Ask for clarification when needed

**In Code Reviews:**
- Provide constructive, actionable feedback
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Approve when changes are good enough (not perfect)
- Be patient with contributors who are learning

**In Issues and PRs:**
- Search before posting to avoid duplicates
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Provide enough context for others to help
- Respond to feedback in a timely manner

### What We Value

- **Learning over expertise:** We welcome newcomers and prioritize helping others learn
- **Collaboration over competition:** We're building together, not racing
- **Empathy over efficiency:** People matter more than code
- **Diversity over uniformity:** Different perspectives make us stronger
- **Inclusion over exclusion:** Actively work to include underrepresented voices

### Professional Development

We encourage community members to:
- Learn new skills (Rust, AI/ML, distributed systems)
- Teach others what you know
- Take on new responsibilities
- Grow into leadership roles
- Contribute in ways that match your interests and availability

### Maintainer Commitments

Maintainers commit to:
- Lead by example in inclusive behavior
- Respond to community concerns within 48 hours
- Review pull requests within 1 week (or communicate delays)
- Document decisions and reasoning
- Welcome and mentor new contributors
- Hold themselves accountable to this Code of Conduct

### Conflict Resolution

If you have a conflict with another community member:

1. **Try to resolve it directly:** Contact the person privately and explain
   your concerns respectfully
2. **Ask for help:** If direct resolution doesn't work, contact a maintainer
3. **Report it:** If the behavior violates this Code of Conduct, report it
   following the process above

We understand that conflicts happen and that good people can have misunderstandings.
Our goal is to help resolve conflicts fairly and compassionately.

### Appeals

Temporary and permanent bans are decided by a group of at least two maintainers
to ensure fairness. If you believe a ban or enforcement action is unfair, you
may appeal by emailing **appeals@superinstance.ai** with:

- Your GitHub username
- The enforcement action taken
- Why you believe the action was unfair
- Any supporting evidence

A different group of maintainers (who were not involved in the original decision)
will review your appeal and respond within 7 days.
